#SuperPacMan-Game-Java

Within the scope of the CS107 (Java Programming) course, I had to create the SuperPacMan Game, using OOP.

- You'll find here the instructions to launch the game and play.
- The SuperPacMan.zip is the project's file.
- CONCEPTION.txt is a brief summary of the choices we've made in our code.


________________________*HOW TO LAUNCH*_________________________

	     To launch the game run the SuperPacMan.jar file


________________________*CONTROLS*_________________________

		Left arrow   :    left
		Right arrow  :    right
		Up arrow     :    up
		Down arrow   :    down
		ESPACE       :    pause
		Q            :    quit the game (after a game over)
		

________________________*GOAL*_________________________

 
	Earn as many points as possible by eating diamonds, cherries while avoiding ghosts trying to eat our Pacman.
	Ghosts are enemies of Pacman but it is possible to scare them away and earn points by making our Pacman invulnerable by eating a bonus. 
	This is characterized by ghosts fleeing our Pacman.
	In order to access what is behind a portal, you must retrieve (among other things eat) the key that corresponds to this portal.
	
________________________*ACTORS*_________________________


	- Pacman : Recognizable between a thousand with its legendary design.
	- Blinky : red ghost
	- Inky : blue ghost. Intelligent ghost who follows you but must remain within a perimeter of his refuge.  
			 Its memory will be reset if you manage to eat it when it is scared
	- Pinky : pink ghost. Intelligent ghost that follows you no matter where you are on the playing area 
			  from the moment you entered its field of vision once. Its memory will be reset if you 
			  manage to eat it when it is scared.
	- Clyde : orange ghost. Very fast ghost. Intelligent ghost that follows you no matter where you are on the 
			  playing area. Clyde appears when all the other Ghosts are afraid, so when you eat a bonus. 
			  Be aware ! It can eat you, but you can't eat him.
			  You must escape him fast. But don't worry, it will vanish when other Ghosts are not afraid anymore. 
	- Transporter portal : Teleportation somewhere on the playground...
	- Rock : Block the passage. Find another way to pass and reach your goal.
	- Heart : Saving lives to face ghosts longer.
	- Shadow : Walk on shadow and you will experience a game over with immediate effect.
	- Bomb : Step on a bomb and you lose points so hard won but be careful, sometimes a bomb can allow you to reach your goal...They are mostly near ghost's refuge !
	- Bonus : Makes you invulnerable and allows you to eat the ghosts that are chasing you.
	- Cherry : Eat one and you’ll see your score explode! But watch out for a sudden rush of adrenaline.


________________________*GAMEPLAY*_________________________


	Level 0: 
		- To unlock the gate and access the door, you must retrieve the key.


	Level 1 :
		- The gate of this level will unlock when you eat all the diamonds of the level but watch out for ghosts! 
		  They are vicious and will follow you to hell.
	
	
	Level 2 :
		- This level is a mix of the two levels you have already successfully crossed. 
		  You must not only open the portals with the keys but also eat all the diamonds in order to access the 
		  hidden door behind the portals. 
		  But beware the ghosts, they are evil !
		  
	Level 3 :
		- You must not only open the portals with the keys but also eat all the diamonds in order to access the 
		  hidden door behind the portals.
		  This level looks strangely like the previous level but the difficulty has moved up again. 
		  You will meet ghosts thirsting for Pacman, a ghost faster than anyone you have ever met, 
		  teleportation portals, rocks that may will block your way, darkness will be lurking in the recesses of your neglect.
